# ProjCIA
Text Analytics Project

The .ipynb file titled 'Project1' is home to the jupyter notebook environment where the raw code for the project can be found. 
The PDF files beginning with C0 are samples of the UFO intelligence from the CIA. A sample of what was in the project is only available on Git due to memory restrictions.
