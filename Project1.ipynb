So  what  actually  happened in  Bvarozawski  rayon,  Brest  Oblast?  Was  it  a  waft  of  a  new  \"cold war,~  which  would  be  very  illogical  and  senseless  in  the  current oolitical  situation?  Or  was  it  absurdity  that  claimed  the  lives  of t.wo  people?  To  put  it  briefly,  Belarus  has  found  itself  facing  a large  intenational  scandal  On  the  one  side  of  the  barricade  there is  a  small,  independent,  and  neutral  state  which  is  just  gaining pestige  and  renown  in  the  world,  and  on  the  other  side  is  the United  States  of  America,  a  powerful  state  in  all  respects. To  remove  all  doubts  and  insinuations,  as  well  as  to  iss~e an official  statement  for  the  foreign  press,  the  members  of  the  state commission  for  investigating  the  aircraft  accident,  which  was  set  up at  the  president\\'S  personal  instruction,  provided  details  of  their investigation  on  14  Septe~er.  They  were  reported  by  Yury  Sivakow, co~mission deputy  chairman  and  chief  of  the  Belarusian  Security Council  Operational  Department,  First  Deputy  Foreign  Minister Valeyy  Tsapkala,  and  State  Aviation  Committee  Chairman  Ryhor Fyoda-aw. So,  at  0914  on  12  September,  the  Antiaircraft  Defense  detected  a balloon  in  Belarusian  aispace.  The  servicemen  were  surprised  by the  balloon\\'s  unexpected  appearance,  since  they  had  no  information about  it.  The  central  command  post  examined  all applications  (fo flight  pe~ts).  As  a  result  of  the  examination,  they  concluded that  this  flying  object  should  not  have  been  in  that  place  at  that time,  since  there  was  no  application  concerning  it.  Following  this, Major  General  Valeryy  Kastenka,\\'  commander  of  the  Antiaircraft Defense,  in  accordance  with  normative  acts,  decided  to  declare  the highest  alert. At  1136  a  take-off  order  was  sent  to  Pruzhany  airfield.  A HI-24 combat  helicopter  took  off  with  the  mission  to  clarify  all  required infornation  about  the  aircraft  and  to  identify  it. In  particular, . the  cew  was  instructed  not  to  qet  closer  to  the  object  than  50 . mete-s. ..  After  a  period  of  time,  the  chopper  approached  the  \"UFO\"  at  100 meters.  This  took  place  4  km  from  another  airbase  -- Asowtsy.  The helic~pte~ crew  reported  the  following /\"We  can  see  a  small  balloon  with  a  diamter  of  3  or  4  meters.  An attachment  resemblinq  a  closed  freight  container  hangs  on  the  rope. The  entire  construction  weighs  approximately  1  tonne.  There  are  no identifying  signs.  Nobody  is  answering  inquiries  on  the  121.5  mHz international  emergency  frequency.  The  object  is  moving  at  an altitude  of  2,300  meters  in  a  north-easterly  direction  over  a military  airfield and  near  a  deploymen  site  of  Strateqic  Missile Approve Troop  units.\"/ The  MI-24  fired  warning  shots  from  600  meters  There  was  no reaction.  Following  this,  the  Air  Defense  commander  himself  gave the  order  to  destroy  the  balloon.  The  helicopter  maneuvered,  made  a ISO-degree  turn,  and  at  1154  -- three  minutes  after  firing  the  first round  -- the  young  captain  again  pulled~he trigger  of  the  heavy ~. , •. ~1 ...... ~._.~~~, •.  •.  .\\'1,\",_.\",  .\\'~  .~ •.. ..\\' .... .-,\\'\\'\\'lA,-- .• for Release )()  0 () /\" .....

Some  20  bullets  pierced  the  balloon,  and  the  go~dola plunged  from  2, 300  meters  and  crashed  9  kilometers  east  of  Bya-oa, in  a  forest  near  the  village  of  Kruhlaye. Soon  afte~ this,  another  two  balloons  we~e detected.  They  were also  warned  by  a  l\\'lelicopter,  but  it  did  not  come  to  shooting,  since their  crews  responded  to  radio  inqui~ies  and  identified  their nationality  by  displaying  U.S.  flags.
